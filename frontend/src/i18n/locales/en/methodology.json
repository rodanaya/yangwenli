    "concentrationDetail": "Vendor concentration, price volatility, and win rate are the top 3 predictors. These reflect Mexico's documented corruption pattern: large vendors capturing institutional monopolies.",
    "directAward": "Direct awards now increase risk",
    "directAwardDetail": "In v4.0, the direct_award coefficient was -0.197 (counterintuitive). With diversified ground truth and new features in v5.0, it correctly flipped to +0.182.",
    "singleBidWeak": "Single bidding is a weak signal",
    "singleBidDetail": "Despite being the #1 indicator in European datasets, single bidding has a near-zero coefficient in Mexico. This reflects the 70% direct award rate — competitive procedures are rare, so single bids carry less information.",
    "coBiddingZero": "Co-bidding provides zero signal",
    "coBiddingZeroDetail": "Regularized to exactly 0.000 in all models. The training cases involve concentration, not collusion rings."
