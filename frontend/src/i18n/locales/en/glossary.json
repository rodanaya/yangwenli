    "title": "Risk Score",
    "description": "A calibrated probability (0-1) estimating the likelihood that a contract involves corruption patterns. Based on 16 statistical features compared against documented corruption cases. Higher = more suspicious."

  "singleBid": {
    "title": "Single Bid",
    "description": "A competitive procedure (not direct award) where only one vendor submitted a bid. This is a red flag because competitive processes should attract multiple bidders. If only one shows up, it may indicate bid-rigging or market manipulation."
  },
  "directAward": {
    "title": "Direct Award",
    "description": "A contract awarded directly to a vendor without competitive bidding. Legal in Mexico under certain conditions (emergencies, sole source). Having one bid in a direct award is expected — it's NOT the same as a single bid."
  },
  "vendorConcentration": {
    "title": "Vendor Concentration",
    "description": "How much of a sector's total procurement value goes to a single vendor. High concentration means one vendor dominates — a top predictor of corruption risk in our model (+0.43 coefficient)."

    "title": "Mahalanobis Distance",
    "description": "A statistical measure of how unusual a contract is across ALL 16 risk dimensions simultaneously. Like asking: 'How far is this contract from normal?' Higher values = more anomalous."
  },
  "zScore": {
    "title": "Z-Score",
    "description": "A standardized measure showing how many standard deviations a value is from the sector/year average. A z-score of +2 means the value is unusually high compared to similar contracts."

    "title": "HHI (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index)",
    "description": "A market concentration measure (0-10,000). Below 1,500 = competitive market. 1,500-2,500 = moderately concentrated. Above 2,500 = highly concentrated. Used to detect vendor monopolies."

  "puLearning": {
    "title": "PU Learning",

  "aucRoc": {
    "title": "AUC-ROC",
    "description": "Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve — measures how well the model distinguishes corrupt from clean contracts. 0.5 = random guessing, 1.0 = perfect. Our v5.0 model achieves 0.960 (test AUC)."
  },
  "industryMismatch": {
    "title": "Industry Mismatch",
    "description": "When a vendor wins contracts in a sector that doesn't match their primary business. For example, a construction company winning health procurement contracts. Suggests shell company or favoritism."

  "priceAnomaly": {
    "title": "Price Anomaly",
    "description": "Contract amount that is statistically unusual compared to similar contracts in the same sector and year. Detected using Tukey's IQR method — values beyond 1.5x the interquartile range are flagged."

  "cobidding": {
    "title": "Co-Bidding Pattern",
    "description": "When two or more vendors consistently appear together in bidding procedures. Can indicate legitimate specialization, but high co-bid rates with alternating wins suggest bid rotation (a form of collusion)."
  },
  "yearEnd": {
    "title": "Year-End Timing",
    "description": "Contracts awarded in December, when agencies rush to spend remaining budget. This 'December dump' creates pressure to award quickly, reducing oversight and increasing corruption risk."
  },
  "thresholdSplitting": {
    "title": "Threshold Splitting",
    "description": "Multiple contracts awarded to the same vendor on the same day, potentially to keep each contract below a threshold that would require competitive bidding. A classic procurement fraud technique."
  },
  "networkRisk": {
    "title": "Network Risk",
    "description": "Risk from vendor relationships — companies that share addresses, legal representatives, or consistently bid together. Network membership can indicate shell company networks or bid-rigging cartels."
  },
  "confidenceInterval": {
    "title": "Confidence Interval",
    "description": "The range within which the true risk score likely falls (95% confidence). A score of 0.35 [0.22, 0.48] means we estimate 35% corruption probability, but it could reasonably be between 22% and 48%."

Built on the same technical architecture as 'Tianguis Digital,' Mexico City's procurement platform during Sheinbaum's tenure as head of government — which disclosed no contracts during that period.
