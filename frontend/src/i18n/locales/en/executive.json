This report presents the findings of a systematic, AI-driven analysis of every one of those contracts. Using a 16-feature per-sector risk model validated against fifteen documented corruption cases, we identified patterns consistent with fraud, collusion, and abuse in contracts worth an estimated {{valueAtRisk}} — {{pct}}% of all procurement value. These findings do not constitute proof of wrongdoing. They are statistical signals that warrant investigation.",

  "sSystem": {
    "label": "Context",
    "title": "How Public Procurement Works — And Why It Matters Now",
    "intro": "To understand what the data shows, it helps to know what the data is supposed to show. Mexico's federal procurement system operates under the Ley de Adquisiciones, Arrendamientos y Servicios del Sector Público (LAASSP), first enacted in 2000. The law establishes three types of contracting procedures, each with different transparency requirements. Above certain thresholds, federal agencies are legally required to use open competitive bidding. The system was designed to ensure public money flows to the best offer — not the most connected one.",
    "proceduresTitle": "The Three Procurement Procedures",
    "proc1Name": "Open Tender",
    "proc1Spanish": "Licitación Pública",
    "proc1When": "Required above legal threshold (~$300K MXN for goods and services)",
    "proc1How": "Public notice, unlimited bidders, minimum 20-day ad period. Mandatory publication on COMPRANET. Most transparent procedure.",
    "proc1Badge": "Full transparency",
    "proc2Name": "Restricted Tender",
    "proc2Spanish": "Invitación a ≥3 Personas",
    "proc2When": "Allowed for mid-range contracts, or when open bidding is deemed impractical",
    "proc2How": "At least 3 vendors invited. Shorter process, limited to invited parties. Less public scrutiny.",
    "proc2Badge": "Partial transparency",
    "proc3Name": "Direct Award",
    "proc3Spanish": "Adjudicación Directa",
    "proc3When": "Below threshold, emergencies, sole-source situations, or — under the 2025 law — when content is classified",
    "proc3How": "No competition. Agency selects vendor directly. Reported after the fact, often with minimal detail.",
    "proc3Badge": "Minimal transparency",
    "gapTitle": "The Gap Between Law and Practice",
    "gapText": "The law requires open competition above threshold. In practice, 71% of all federal contracts across 23 years skip open competition — either through direct award or restricted tender. Three mechanisms explain the gap: contracts are split to stay below thresholds (threshold splitting); emergency exceptions are invoked broadly; and the 2025 reform now explicitly allows direct awards when contract content is classified as reserved information, embedding opacity directly into the legal framework.",
    "oversightTitle": "The Oversight Architecture",
    "oversightText": "Three institutions were designed to enforce transparency. COMPRANET (1996–2025) was the mandatory federal procurement portal — every purchase above threshold was required to be published there. INAI was the independent transparency watchdog — citizens and journalists could appeal to it when agencies refused information requests. The ASF (Auditoría Superior de la Federación) is the federal audit court with independent review powers over contract execution. Of these three, only ASF retains full operational independence.",
    "crisisTitle": "2024–2025: The Infrastructure Is Being Dismantled",
    "crisisText": "In August 2024 — before any law changed — 1.9 million contracts from 2012–2023 (4.7 trillion MXN) were silently removed from COMPRANET's public interface. In December 2024, INAI was constitutionally abolished and replaced by 'Transparencia para el Pueblo,' an agency housed within the executive branch it was created to oversee, operating on roughly 2% of INAI's former budget. In April 2025, Congress voted 68–23 to formally abolish COMPRANET and replace it with ComprasMX — a platform that shares its architecture with Tianguis Digital, the procurement system used during Sheinbaum's time as Mexico City head of government, which disclosed no contracts in that period. The new law includes a 5-year data retention clause that analysts estimate would eventually remove records of 2.6 million contracts worth 9.9 trillion MXN from official public access.",
    "crisisNote": "The 3.1 million contracts in this database were captured before these changes. They represent a historical record that is becoming progressively harder to access through official channels. Independent archiving is the only safeguard.",

    "intro": "Before asking which contracts are suspicious, the data reveals something more fundamental: three structural patterns that pervade Mexican federal procurement across all administrations, sectors, and decades. These are not anomalies — they are the system.",
    "p1DirectAward": {
      "label": "Pattern 01",
      "name": "The Direct-Award Economy",
      "desc": "{{pct}}% of all federal contracts are awarded without open competition — either as direct awards or restricted tenders. Conventional anti-corruption frameworks treat direct awards as red flags. The Mexican data reveals something more troubling: <bold>competition itself is largely absent</bold>. There is no tender to rig when there is only one bidder.",
      "note": "This is not a recent anomaly. The non-competitive rate has remained above 65% across all five administrations since 2002."
    },
    "p2December": {
      "label": "Pattern 02",
      "name": "The December Rush",
      "desc": "Every December, contract awards spike 1.33× above the monthly average — a pattern that has repeated without interruption across 23 years and five administrations. It is driven by the fiscal year's use-it-or-lose-it budget logic: agencies rush to commit unspent funds before December 31. Rushed procurement is compromised procurement.",
      "note": "In years with sufficient data, the spike was statistically significant in 3 of 10 measured years. The pattern is structural; its corruption impact is compounded by deadline pressure."
    },
    "p3Concentration": {
      "label": "Pattern 03",
      "name": "The Value Concentration Paradox",
      "desc": "7.9% of total procurement value sits in contracts flagged as high or critical risk — and that risk concentrates in a vanishingly small number of dominant vendors. The vendors who capture the most value are also the most statistically anomalous. Concentration is not just a symptom of corruption; it is its strongest statistical predictor.",
      "note": "Price volatility — vendors with wildly varying contract sizes — is the #1 corruption signal. The corruption is in who keeps winning, not in which procedure type was used."
    }
  },

  "s1": {
    "title": "The Threat",
    "p1": "Of the {{totalValue}} in analyzed procurement, an estimated <bold>{{valueAtRisk}}</bold> — {{pct}}% of all value — sits in contracts flagged as high or critical risk. To put this in context, Mexico's entire annual federal education budget is approximately 400 billion pesos. The value at risk in this dataset is roughly equivalent to {{years}} years of education spending.",
    "p2": "Risk is not evenly distributed. The bulk of flagged value concentrates in a small number of high-value contracts from dominant vendors in health, infrastructure, and energy.

In our model, direct award procedures carry only a slightly positive coefficient (+0.182), providing minimal discriminating signal.

Price volatility — vendors with wildly varying contract sizes — is the strongest single predictor of corruption in v5.0."

    "title": "The Proof",
    "p1": "Any model can flag contracts. The question is whether it flags the right ones. We validated our model against {{cases}} documented Mexican corruption cases spanning {{contracts}} contracts from {{vendors}} matched vendors. These are not hypothetical — they are cases that led to criminal investigations, arrests, and public scandal. The model was asked: would you have flagged these?",
    "p2": "The answer: <bold>yes, in {{detectionRate}}% of cases</bold> (at medium risk or above). The model achieves an AUC-ROC of {{auc}}, meaning it correctly ranks a randomly chosen corrupt contract above a clean one {{aucPct}}% of the time.",

For Segalmex, the earliest flagged contracts predate the 2020 investigation by several years.",
    "p3": "The strongest detections occur in cases involving <bold>concentrated vendors in health and agriculture</bold> — IMSS (99.0%), Segalmex (94.3%), COVID-19 procurement (91.8%). These cases share a common pattern: a small number of vendors capturing outsized market share. Detection is weakest for cases involving <bold>bribery and conflict of interest</bold> — Grupo Higa (33.3%), Cyber Robotic (43.2%) — where corruption operates through relationships rather than statistical patterns in the procurement data itself."
  },

  "s3": {
    "title": "Where the Risk Concentrates",
    "p1": "Three sectors dominate the risk landscape. <bold>Health</bold> (Salud) accounts for the largest volume — {{healthContracts}} contracts worth {{healthValue}}. <bold>Infrastructure</bold> carries fewer contracts but enormous per-unit values. <bold>Energy</bold> combines both volume and value in a sector with structural concentration (few vendors can serve Pemex and CFE).",

      "name": "Health",
      "text": "The largest sector by contract volume. Home to the IMSS ghost company network and COVID-19 procurement fraud — two of the three largest corruption cases in the dataset. The sheer scale means even a modest risk rate translates to enormous absolute value at risk."
    },
    "infrastructure": {
      "name": "Infrastructure",
      "text": "Relatively low risk rate, but dominated by mega-contracts from firms like CICSA and ICA. A single flagged infrastructure contract can be worth more than thousands of smaller flagged contracts in other sectors combined."
    },

      "name": "Agriculture",
      "text": "Only 3.2% of total procurement value but disproportionately represented in high-risk contracts. The Segalmex scandal (LICONSA, DICONSA) exposed systematic fraud in food distribution — a sector where oversight was historically weak."

  },

  "s5": {
    "title": "The Network",

These patterns affected over <bold>1 million contracts</bold>.",
    "p2": "Two key patterns emerge: <bold>cover bidding</bold>, where partners consistently submit losing bids to create the appearance of competition, and <bold>bid rotation</bold>, where vendors take turns winning in predictable patterns.

      "Sheinbaum": "Early data only (2025). The direct award rate stands at 66% — a slight decrease from López Obrador's 79.5%. But the administration's most consequential procurement decisions have not been in the contracts themselves. In April 2025, COMPRANET — the platform this entire analysis is built on — was abolished by Congress and replaced by ComprasMX. In December 2024, INAI was constitutionally eliminated. The new procurement law expands grounds for direct awards when information is classified, and the 5-year data retention clause threatens the long-term public record.
