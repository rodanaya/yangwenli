    "lead": "Between 2002 and 2025, the Mexican federal government awarded {{totalContracts}} public procurement contracts worth a combined {{totalValue}} — roughly {{totalValueUSD}}. This report presents the findings of a systematic, AI-driven analysis of every one of those contracts. Using a 16-feature per-sector calibrated model validated against fifteen documented corruption cases, we identified patterns consistent with fraud, collusion, and abuse in contracts worth an estimated {{valueAtRisk}} — {{pct}}% of all procurement value. These findings do not constitute proof of wrongdoing. They are statistical signals that warrant investigation.",

    "p1": "Of the {{totalValue}} in analyzed procurement, an estimated <bold>{{valueAtRisk}}</bold> — {{pct}}% of all value — sits in contracts flagged as high or critical risk. To put this in context, Mexico's entire annual federal education budget is approximately 400 billion pesos. The value at risk in this dataset is roughly equivalent to {{years}} years of education spending.",
    "p2": "Risk is not evenly distributed. The bulk of flagged value concentrates in a small number of high-value contracts from dominant vendors in health, infrastructure, and energy. The remaining {{remainingPct}}% of value falls in medium or low risk categories — not clean, but less urgently suspicious.",

    "p3": "A counterintuitive finding: <bold>direct awards are not the primary risk signal</bold>. In our model, direct award procedures carry only a slightly positive coefficient (+0.182), providing minimal discriminating signal. The real red flag is not how a contract is awarded, but <bold>who keeps winning</bold>. Price volatility — vendors with wildly varying contract sizes — is the strongest single predictor of corruption in v5.0."
  },

  "s2": {
    "title": "The Proof",
    "p1": "Any model can flag contracts. The question is whether it flags the right ones. We validated our model against {{cases}} documented Mexican corruption cases spanning {{contracts}} contracts from {{vendors}} matched vendors. These are not hypothetical — they are cases that led to criminal investigations, arrests, and public scandal. The model was asked: would you have flagged these?",
    "p2": "The answer: <bold>yes, in {{detectionRate}}% of cases</bold> (at medium risk or above). The model achieves an AUC-ROC of {{auc}}, meaning it correctly ranks a randomly chosen corrupt contract above a clean one {{aucPct}}% of the time.",

    "earlyWarning": "<accent>Early warning value:</accent> The model would have raised alarms on IMSS ghost company contracts as early as 2008 — <italic>eight years</italic> before the scandal became public in 2016. For Segalmex, the earliest flagged contracts predate the 2020 investigation by several years.",
    "p3": "The strongest detections occur in cases involving <bold>concentrated vendors in health and agriculture</bold> — IMSS (99.0%), Segalmex (94.3%), COVID-19 procurement (91.8%). These cases share a common pattern: a small number of vendors capturing outsized market share. Detection is weakest for cases involving <bold>bribery and conflict of interest</bold> — Grupo Higa (33.3%), Cyber Robotic (43.2%) — where corruption operates through relationships rather than statistical patterns in the procurement data itself."
  },

  "s3": {
    "title": "Where the Risk Concentrates",
    "p1": "Three sectors dominate the risk landscape. <bold>Health</bold> (Salud) accounts for the largest volume — {{healthContracts}} contracts worth {{healthValue}}. <bold>Infrastructure</bold> carries fewer contracts but enormous per-unit values. <bold>Energy</bold> combines both volume and value in a sector with structural concentration (few vendors can serve Pemex and CFE).",
    "riskLabel": "ESTIMATED VALUE AT RISK BY SECTOR",
    "health": {
      "name": "Health",
      "text": "The largest sector by contract volume. Home to the IMSS ghost company network and COVID-19 procurement fraud — two of the three largest corruption cases in the dataset. The sheer scale means even a modest risk rate translates to enormous absolute value at risk."
    },
    "infrastructure": {
      "name": "Infrastructure",
      "text": "Relatively low risk rate, but dominated by mega-contracts from firms like CICSA and ICA. A single flagged infrastructure contract can be worth more than thousands of smaller flagged contracts in other sectors combined."
    },
    "agriculture": {
      "name": "Agriculture",
      "text": "Only 3.2% of total procurement value but disproportionately represented in high-risk contracts. The Segalmex scandal (LICONSA, DICONSA) exposed systematic fraud in food distribution — a sector where oversight was historically weak."

    "title": "Who Is Involved",
    "p1": "The top 10 vendors by contract value collectively hold <bold>{{totalValue}}</bold> in procurement. Among them, two are confirmed participants in documented corruption cases.

In contrast, vendors with fewer but higher-risk contracts may represent more actionable investigation targets. The <shield></shield> icon marks vendors confirmed in documented corruption cases."
  },

  "s5": {
    "title": "The Network",
    "p1": "Corruption rarely operates in isolation. Our co-bidding analysis identified <bold>8,701 vendors</bold> with suspicious bidding patterns — vendors that frequently appear in the same procurement procedures but rarely compete against each other. These patterns affected over <bold>1 million contracts</bold>.",
    "p2": "Two key patterns emerge: <bold>cover bidding</bold>, where partners consistently submit losing bids to create the appearance of competition, and <bold>bid rotation</bold>, where vendors take turns winning in predictable patterns.

    "coBidThreshold": "Co-bid threshold",
    "p3": "Institution concentration also plays a critical role. When a single vendor captures a disproportionate share of an institution's procurement budget, it creates dependency and reduces competitive pressure — conditions ripe for corruption. Our analysis measures this through the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) at the institution level."

We now reject any contract exceeding 100 billion MXN and flag contracts above 10 billion for manual review.",
    "p2": "Amount validation is critical: Mexico's entire federal budget is approximately 8 trillion MXN annually. The largest legitimate PEMEX contracts are typically 1-5 billion MXN. Our validation rules ensure that data errors do not silently corrupt the analytics."
